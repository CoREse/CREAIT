## CREATI
CREAIT (CRE AI Tool or CREative AI Tool) is a versatile and open-source tool to utilize the magnificent AI now existing.

## Why CREAIT?
### Motive
Currently the best way to utilize the ChatGPT is through API I think. To utilize the OpenAI API, I need an API client. The existing best API client is a tool called ChatBox. But that tool has a huge problem: it is a fake opensource project. The project is claimed to be open-source, but actually the release is closed-source. That is very deceptive, I don't like it. Moreover, the closed-source nature makes it hard to make modifications by yourself, and of course, it can't lend power from the community. Maybe because there isn't a good enough alternative so the author thinks he can do whatever he wants.

So here I am, bringing a truly open-source, yet powerful and versatile AI tool, namely CREAIT. The development has been using ChatGPT a lot, since I am a rookie developer in the field of webpages, not to mention electron or tauri. The license is MIT, so basically everyone can use or modify the code to do anything!

### Features
CREAIT now interact with OpenAI API. It can not only chat with the famous ChatGPT models (gpt-3.5 or gpt-4), but can also create images or speeches by change the model to dall-e or tts-1 (currently I don't find other chat tools that integrate these features).

Here is a simple list of what CREAIT can do or will support soon:
-   [x] Chat with chat-gpt
